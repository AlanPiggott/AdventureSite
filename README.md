# AdventureSite
A mock website of an adventure website

I built this website using HTML, CSS AND Bootstrap 4. 

What I learned:
Creating this website thought me a lot about reading documentation and the Bootstrap framework. I learned how to position elements
while maintaining a responsive design on all platforms.

Using different animations such as "aos" which creates the scrolling animation on elements. 

I would love to add some backend feature to this in the future along and tinker with other designs.
